## What is?

Weird melon aims to be a blog platform for programmers.

> Fun fact: I don't know what to name this project, so while I'm creating the repo, I was eating a melon flavored ice cream, and it tasted kinda weird... hence this project is called Weird Melon (Y ^ 3 ^)Y

## Problem

There are already so many blog platform out there, you might ask why yet another blog platform? That's because I noticed that there are no blog platform that fits what I imagine. I'll describe what issue I faced with each blog platform.

### medium

**not programmer friendly**

Recently, medium.com is gaining more and more users and there are a lot of contents. The good thing about medium.com is that it has no setup time to use it. All you need is just signing up and you are good to go. Besides that, it helps you to match the audience, you can put `tags` to your post and medium with help you find the correct audience to read your content. While it is all amazing, I feel that the minimalistic editor is lacking for programmers. 

As a programmer, when I wanted to write a technical blog, I almost always need to include some code block with syntax highlighting, however, medium only provides block like this without highlighting:

```
var test = "hello world"
if (test.length > 0){
// do stuff
}
```

**no inline code block**

Also, it is lacking `inline-code-block` just like `this`.

**export only in html**

Another issue with medium is it owns the content, you can export the content, but they will appear in html: https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214043918-Export-content-from-Medium

It will be difficult to repost your blog to somewhere else.

**no markdown editing**

I used Slack, Github, Unfuddle, Trello, etc on a daily basis. Most if not all of the tools support markdown editing, and I get used to markdown editing as a programmer, hence, I would prefer markdown editing, because it's standardized everywhere else.

**no emoji :sob:**

You cannot input emoji like Github

### Wordpress
It's not as easy to setup as medium, and it doesn't help you to match your audience like medium does. It is basically a web page creation platform.

## Weird Melon
So... weird melon aims to solve all this! of course it's going to be difficult, since all this platforms have been around for very long, and has improved and became mature and stable over time. But anyway, that's the reason this is started!
